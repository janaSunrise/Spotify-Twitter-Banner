Callback based authentication has been built into the app. If you're running for the first time, or the refresh
token stored in the configuration file (`~/.spotify_refresh_token`) could not be discovered, you will be prompted
to authenticate with Spotify. You will be asked to open a URL, which redirects to the callback URL setup. Copy the
code from the URL and paste it in the terminal.

have been split into 3 classes. You can configure the settings in the config file, as you wish and also ensure
that the variables are set properly, and they work.

Along with that, you can also change the interval of the banner update, in `__main__.py` where the `sleep` is run.
