Callback based authentication has been built into the App. If you're running for the first time, or the refresh
token stored in the configuration file (`~/.spotify_refresh_token`) could not be discovered, you will be prompted

code from the URL and paste it in the terminal.

have been split into 3 classes. You can configure the settings in the config file, as you wish and also ensure
that the variables are set properly, and they work.
